# Dissertation
Main MATLAB and Mathematica codes used in my dissertation. <br>
These codes were mainly used to: <br>
 * Plot generic and special orbits for the dPI and qPVI systems. <br>
 * Find the leading order terms of the asymptotic expansion for the combinatorial orbit. <br> 
 * Compute the 3d map center manifold and use it to approximate the combinatorial orbit. <br>
 * Solve a series of linear systems whose solutions were used to construct the map count generating functions. <br>
 * Generalize to the 6-valent setting.
